## Distributed Systems & Fault-Tolerance

Explored the principles of distributed systems, including their architecture, challenges, and fault-tolerance mechanisms to ensure system reliability and availability in the face of failures.

## Distributed Filesystems & HDFS

Studied distributed filesystems, with a focus on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), understanding its architecture, data replication, and how it enables scalable and reliable storage for big data applications.

## MapReduce & YARN

Learned about the MapReduce programming model for processing large datasets in parallel, and YARN for cluster resource management and job scheduling in Hadoop ecosystems.

## Hive & Pig

Explored Hive for SQL-like querying of large datasets stored in Hadoop, and Pig for high-level data flow scripting to process and analyze big data.

## Spark & Spark SQL

Studied Apache Spark, its in-memory processing capabilities, resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), and Spark SQL for structured data processing in big data environments.

## Kafka & Spark Streaming

Learned about Apache Kafka for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications, and Spark Streaming for scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams.

## NoSQL & CAP

Understood NoSQL databases and their advantages for handling big data, along with the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) and its implications for distributed database systems.

## Key-Value & Wide-Column Stores

Explored key-value stores and wide-column stores as types of NoSQL databases, their data models, use cases, and popular implementations like Redis and Apache Cassandra.

## Document Databases

Studied document-oriented databases, their flexible schema design, query capabilities, and popular implementations like MongoDB, understanding their advantages for handling semi-structured data in big data scenarios.
